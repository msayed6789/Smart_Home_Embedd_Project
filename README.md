# Smart_Home_Embedd_Project
## The Smart Home Project features dual modes for controlling four rooms , TV and Air condition, with password-protected access stored on EEPROM. It includes temperature sensor-driven air conditioning for precise climate control, ensuring a secure and efficient home automation experience.
<br>
<br>

# System Modes
## Owner Mode:
### The features
#### Rooms:Lights ON-OFF.
#### TV:ON-OFF
#### Air condition:will be controlled by using temperature sensor and when reach the wanted romm temperature, it will be off to save the energy, also the wanted temperature can be changed during run time.
## Guest Mode:
### The features
#### Rooms:Lights ON-OFF.
## Block Mode:
### The system will be blocked after three trial wrong password for 20 seconds.

# Technical Features:
## Using AVR (ATmega32) Peripheral used: (DIO - ADC - External Interrupt - Timer - SPI - Internal EEPROM).
## The project consists of 2 Microcontrollers (Master & Slave) are connected together with SPI Protocol & 3 Modes "Owner Mode, Guest Mode & Block Mode".
## Master MCU: it is connected to (LCD - Keypad - 3LEDS).
## Slave MCU : it is connected to (6LEDS"Rooms,TV&Air Condition" - LM35 "Temp Sensor for Air Condition").
